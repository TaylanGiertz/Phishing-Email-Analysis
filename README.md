# Phishing-Email-Analysis
## Summary
After receiving a SIEM alert, I used the SIEM to examine and analyze email headers, conducted static analysis of URLs and sender IPs with VirusTotal and Cisco Talos Intelligence, and performed dynamic analysis using AnyRun. I then responded to the SIEM alert by isolating the computer that had accessed the site and compiled and submitted a detailed report.
